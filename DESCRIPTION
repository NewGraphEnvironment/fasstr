Description: 'fasstr' (Flow Analysis Summary Statistics Tool for R) provides useful functions to tidy, 
    analyze, and visualize daily streamflow time series data. This package provides functions with quick
    solutions for: screening for missing dates and outliers; summarizing and plotting various daily, month, 
    and long-term statistics; trending annual patterns; and computing low and high-flow frequency analyses. 
    Various function arguments allow for easy customization of analyses and plotting. While not required
    for use, this package integrates the 'tidyhydat' package to extract and tidy streamflow data from a 
    Water Survey of Canada HYDAT database.
